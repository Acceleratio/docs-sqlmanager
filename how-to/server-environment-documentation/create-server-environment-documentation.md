This section describes how you can generate server environment documentation using SysKit SQL Manager.

1. Use the __Take Snapshot__ button to load your server environment settings, or choose to __Open__ an existing server environment snapshot. You can view all of your snapshots if you navigate to the __Backstage Actions Screen__ and click the __View Snapshots__ button or if you go directly to the __Snapshots__ tab.
2. Click __Generate__ from the left-side navigation bar and select the format in which you would like to create your farm documentation. You can generate server environment documentation in __.docx__ and __.xlsx__ format.
3. The server environment settings you want to export can be selected from the drop-down options. The selection you make can be saved and used as a template for generating future documentation. SysKit SQL Manager is supplied with predefined documentation templates, with commonly used options already pre-selected. The following documentation templates are available:  __All__, __Regular Documentation__ or __Simple Documentation__.Use the Up and Down arrows to rearrange the order of your documentation.
4. With the __Options__ tab you can choose to add extra spacing after each heading.
5. Click the __Generate__ button, then wait a few seconds, and your server environment documentation will be generated!
