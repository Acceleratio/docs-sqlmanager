SysKit SQL Manager allows administrators to configure a schedule to create automatic server environment snapshots. Once configured, the snapshot service can save your server environment settings and email them to selected users if any changes are detected.

1. Navigate to the __Backstage Configuration Screen__ and click __Configure__.
1. Skip to the __Service Settings__ option, select the __Enable Service__ checkbox and type in the service account details. Click __Validate Account__ and then __Next__ to continue.
3. Once the Configuration Wizard is finished, navigate to the __Backstage Configuration Screen__ > __Options__ > __Service Settings__. Define the period for creating snapshots with the Data Collection Interval. Click __Save__ when finished.
4. Skip to the __Snapshot Options__ and customize the snapshot options that are going to be used by the SysKit SQL Manager Service, such as __Load Options__ and __Load Performance__. Click __Save__ when finished.
