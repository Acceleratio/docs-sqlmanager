This section explains how you can use the Compare Wizard to compare different SQL Servers.

1. Select __Single SQL Server__ as a comparison type. Click __Next__ to continue.
2. Under the __Snapshot Selection__, you can select different, previously taken snapshots and compare them. You can choose just one snapshot if you wish to compare two different servers but using the same snapshot reference.
3. Choose a certain server on both source and target sides. The Results window shows the detected differences marked using different colors. The upper part of the window shows all available environment reports in a hierarchical structure, while the bottom half displays the detected differences between currently selected objects.
