The __Scheduled Actions__ button is located next to the [Security Wizard](#internal/security-managment/security-managment-wizard/) button in the Server Permissions ribbon. It allows you to view and manage actions scheduled using the Security Wizard.

* Check all scheduled actions, their statuses, execution and undo dates and more.
* Select a row in the grid to see more details about the scheduled action: creator, creation date, notification emails, selected servers, roles, and principals.
* If you change your mind about executing scheduled actions, use the __Delete__ link to cancel and delete them. You can also delete finished actions when you donâ€™t need them.
* Click the __Log__ button to check the log of changes applied by finished actions.
