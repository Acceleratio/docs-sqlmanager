### Problem:
Connection timeout expired. Server is taking too long to respond.

### Solution:
This error commonly occurs when an instance of the SQL Server Database Engine is not running, when the server name was typed incorrectly or when there are network problems or firewalls. Try retaking the snapshot at a later time, or check [this article](https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms190181) to learn more.
