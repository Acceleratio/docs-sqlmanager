## Features
* Live Explorer – Gives you the ability to explore SQL Server settings and databases in live mode, without having to create a snapshot.

We have released the following actions: __Show Connections__, __Kill Connections__, __Detach Database__, __Drop Database__, __Change State__ (to make a database read only), and __Change Owner__.

## Bug fixes
* When SQLDocKit was not installed on a domain computer, it would crash.
