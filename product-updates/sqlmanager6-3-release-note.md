## Features
* __Live Explorer__ – Gives you the ability to explore SQL Server settings and databases in live mode, without having to create a snapshot.
* __SQL Management Actions__ – We have introduced new features that ease day-to-day operations for SQL Server administrators dealing with a large number of databases.

We have released the following actions: __Show Connections__, __Kill Connections__, __Detach Database__, __Drop Database__, __Change State__ (to make a database read only), and __Change Owner__.

## Bug Fixes
When SQLDocKit was not installed on a domain computer, it would crash.
