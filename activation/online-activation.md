The server license is tied to the server on which it is installed. The license is per SQL Server and that means you can monitor all SQL Servers in your environment from a single server.

1. Navigate to the Backstage Help Screen and click the License Details section to begin the activation process.
2. When the Activation window pops up, select Server or Site.
3. Enter the company name and your product key.

The product key is a combination of letters and numbers. To claim your activation key, please log in to our customer portal. There you can track your orders and download the latest application versions to which you are entitled. When a major upgrade becomes available, all customers with valid software assurances will have their profiles refreshed with new version download links and brand-new activation keys.
Once you have entered the product key, it will be validated by our activation server. If your key is valid, a green check mark will appear next to it.

4. Click Activate to begin the activation process.
The activation will be complete in a couple of seconds and itâ€™s a one-time process.
