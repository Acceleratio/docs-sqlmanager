# Server License
__The__ server license is tied to the server on which it is installed. The license is per SQL Server and that means you can monitor all SQL Servers in your environment from a single server.

1. Navigate to the __Backstage Help Screen__ and click the __License Details__ section to begin the activation process.
2. When the Activation window pops up, select __Server or Site__.
3. Enter the company name and your product key.

The product key is a combination of letters and numbers. To claim your activation key, please log in to our [customer portal](https://customers.acceleratio.net). There you can track your orders and download the latest application versions to which you are entitled. When a major upgrade becomes available, all customers with valid software assurances will have their profiles refreshed with new version download links and brand-new activation keys.
Once you have entered the product key, it will be validated by our activation server. If your key is valid, a green check mark will appear next to it.

4. Click __Activate__ to begin the activation process.
The activation will be complete in a couple of seconds and it’s a one-time process.

# Site License

1. Navigate to the __Backstage Help Screen Help__ and click the __License Details__ section to begin the activation process.
2. When the Activation window pops-up, select __Server or Site__.
3. Enter the company name and your product key.

The product key is a combination of letters and numbers. To claim your activation key, please log in to our [customer portal](https://customers.acceleratio.net).

# Consultant License

The consultant license can be activated on any server, and you can monitor an unlimited number of SQL Servers. However, you need to have a valid SysKit SQL Manager consultant subscription. Please note that consultant license is intended for external (customer server) usage only.

Here is how to activate a consultant license:

1. Navigate to the __Backstage Help Screen__ and click the __License Details__ section to begin the activation process.
2. When the Activation window pops up, select __Consultant__.
3. Enter your email address and password.

Provide the same email and password that you received during your online purchase. [Contact us](https://www.sqldockit.com/support/contact-us/) if you do not have the necessary activation information.
Select the __One-time activation__ check box for a short-term SQLDocKit activation. When you finish using the application, the license details will be deleted and the product will no longer be active. This feature can be quite convenient when you are documenting your customers’ SQL Servers.

4. Click __Activate__ to begin the activation process. The activation lasts for a couple of seconds, and it needs to be repeated on every server on which you wish to activate SysKit SQL Manager. You can activate your license on an unlimited number of customer’s servers while your subscription is active.

> __Please note!__ The consultant license requires re-activation every 30 days. When your current consultant subscription expires, SysKit SQL Manager will warn you that re-activation is needed.
