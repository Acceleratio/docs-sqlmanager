### What happens during product activation?

Product activation is a simple process that occurs when you register a purchased product. To activate the product, you will enter the product key and it will be authenticated on the Acceleratio Ltd. product activation server. The entire activation process is quick and easy, and the majority of users will have to activate the product only once.

### Who will be required to activate their products?

Anyone who purchases SysKit SQL Manager will be required to activate the product. If the product is ordered online from the Acceleratio Ltd. website, the product activation code will be sent via email.

### When am I required to activate my product?

You must activate your product within 30 days.

### What happens if I do not activate my product?

If you do not activate your product within a 30-day trial period, it will stop collecting data about your SQL servers until you activate it.

### If I do not have the product activation code needed for activation, how can I get one?

If you cannot find your product activation code, contact our [support team](https://www.SysKit SQL Manager.com/support/).

### How do I activate my product?

ou can activate your product 24 hours a day, seven days a week via Internet. To activate your product, enter your product activation code and then click Activate. You must be connected to the Internet for the activation to be successful.

### What does Acceleratio Ltd. do with the information sent during the product activation process?

We use the information only to verify that your product is used within the scope allowed by the Acceleratio Ltd. end-user license agreement (EULA). The information is stored in a database and used only for product activation data. If you register your product, none of the activation information will ever be linked to your personal customer information.

### What is product activation?

Product activation is an anonymous, secure, hassle-free process that authenticates licensed users during the installation process. The process verifies that the product activation code is legitimate and that it has not been activated on more systems than the number allowed by the Acceleratio Ltd. EULA.

### Why does Acceleratio Ltd. require their customers to activate the software?

Product activation is a simple way to reduce and deter unauthorized use and casual copying of Acceleratio Ltd. products with a minimal effect on our loyal customers.

### Will the activation process ever send data to Acceleratio Ltd. after I activate my product?

No. Activation is a secure, anonymous, one-time process. After activation is complete, the license manager runs alongside the product for the sole purpose of verifying the integrity of the license file and the validity of the product license. The activation technology in the product does not send any additional information to Acceleratio Ltd.

### How long does product activation takes to complete?

Product activation is a one-time process that is typically completed immediately after software installation. The activation typically takes 2-5 seconds to complete.

### When is product reactivation required?

Product reactivation is required only under exceptional circumstancesâ€”for example, you upgrade or replace your server or if the activation process detects that the license has been tampered with.

### What if I have more than one server? Does the new license allow me to use the software on mutiple servers?

One SysKit SQL Manager server license can be activated on a single server from which you can monitor all the SQL Servers in your environment. If you want to use SysKit SQL Manager on multiple servers, you will need to purchase an additional server license for every server on which you want to install SysKit SQL Manager.

### What are the Consulant license restrictions?

There are several restrictions in the Consultant edition:

* Consultant License Call Home: Once activated on a SQL server or on a workstation, the Consultant license must to be re-activated every 30 days.
* The license file generated for the offline activation is only valid for 72 hours. If you try to activate SysKit SQL Manager with a license file generated more than 72 hours prior to your activation attempt, the activation process will fail.
* The SysKit SQL Manager Service is not available with the Consultant license. This also means that the following features are unavailable due to this restriction:
  * Automatic Snapshots
  * Automatic Data Retention
  * Automatic Subscriptions
  * Automatic Security Management

> Please note! All these actions can still be manually executed. 

### Are there any trial limitations?

The SysKit SQL Manager trial version has the following limitations:

* Limited information is available in the generated documentation and exported reports. Exporting files to Word or Excel formats is not available. You can see what the exported reports and documentation look like in the full version.
