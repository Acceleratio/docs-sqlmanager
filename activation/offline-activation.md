# Consultant License

The consultant license can be activated on any server, but you need to have a valid SysKit SQL Manager consultant subscription. Please note that the consultant license is intended for external (customer server) usage only. Here is how to activate a consultant license offline:

1. Navigate to the __Backstage Help Screen__ and click the __License Details__ section to begin the activation process.
2. When the activation window pops up, select __Consultant__ and then click the __offline activation__ link.
3. When the activation window appears, follow these steps:

* Go to this [activation link](https://customers.acceleratio.net/activation/?P=SQLDocKit) and select the __Consultant__ activation option.
* On the activation page, login with your username and password. You need to use the same email and password that you received during your online purchase. [Contact us](https://www.sqldockit.com/support/contact-us/) if you do not have the necessary activation information.
* Select the __Consultant License__ option, provide your email and password, and then click __Select file__ to upload a file containing your environment details.
* Click  __Generate the license file__ and download it.

4. Go back to the SysKit SQL Manager offline activation window and click __Browse__ to locate and upload your license file.

> __Please note__! The consultant license file will be invalid after 72 hours of its generation.

Select the __One-time activation__ check box for a short-term SysKit SQL Manager activation. When you finish using the application, license details will be deleted and product will no longer be active. This feature can be quite convenient when you are documenting your customerâ€™s SQL Servers.

5. Click __Activate__ to begin the activation. The activation can last for a couple of seconds and the same activation processes need to be repeated for every server on which you will activate SysKit SQL Manager. You can activate your license on an unlimited number of customer servers while your subscription is active.
