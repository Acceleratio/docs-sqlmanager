1. Click on the __Offline Activation__ link and a new activation dialog will appear. Follow these steps:
   * Click on the __Generate__ button to generate a __License Details (.dlic) file__.
   * Navigate to the [Activation Page](https://customers.acceleratio.net/activation/?P=sqldockit) and  select the __Server License__ activation option.

   * Download the __license file (.lic).__
1. Click on the __Browse__ button, locate your license file and upload it.
1. Click the __Activate__ button. Activation takes a couple of seconds and is a one time process. You can activate SysKit SQL Manager on a single server with one key to monitor all the SQL Servers in your environment.

### Consultant License

The Consultant license can be activated on any server, but you need to have a valid SysKit SQL Manager Consultant subscription. Please take special care that the Consultant license is intended for external (customers' servers) usage only. Here is how to activate a Consultant license offline.

1. From the left navigation bar on the __Backstage Screen__ select __Help__ and click on the __License Details__ section to begin the activation process.
1. Click on the __Offline Activation__ link and a new activation dialog will appear. Follow these steps:
    * Click on the __Generate__ button to generate a __License Details (.dlic) file__.
   * Navigate to the [Activation Page](https://customers.acceleratio.net/activation/?P=sqldockit) and  select the __Consultant License__ activation option.
   * Select the __Version__ of SysKit SQL Manager you are creating a license for.
   * On the Activation Page, login with your username and password. You need to use the same email and password that you received during your online purchase. [Contact us](https://www.sqldockit.com/support/contact-us/) if you do not have the activation information.
   * Upload the __License Details (.dlic) file__.
   * Click on the __Generate license file!__.
   * Download the __license file (.lic).__.
1. Click on the __Browse__ button, locate your license file and upload it.
1. Click the __Activate__ button. Activation takes a couple of seconds and is a one time process.
    * The __license file (.lic)__ is __only valid__ for the user account and server where the __License Details (.dlic)__ file was generated in step 2.

The __One-time activation__ option allows short-term activation of SysKit SQL Manager. If you check this box, the license details will be deleted and the license will be deactivated when the application is closed. This feature can be quite convenient when you are documenting your customer's environment.

__Please note__! The Consultant license file is valid for 72 hours from the time of generation.
