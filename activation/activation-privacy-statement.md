SysKit Ltd. needs you to activate your copy of SysKit SQL Manager so we can verify that your product was purchased legally. During the activation process, neither your personal data nor your product key will be sent to SysKit Ltd.

Activation is based on a number of factors that are calculated during the activation process. The activation process only identifies the computer; it does not include information about your software or data that resides on your computer or any other information about your computer model or environment.
