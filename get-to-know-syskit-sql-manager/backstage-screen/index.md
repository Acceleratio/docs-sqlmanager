The Backstage Actions view is a set of commands that can be used to quickly approach major SysKit SQL Manager options. The following options are available:

* The __Take Snapshot__ button loads your server environment data.
* The __View Snapshots__ button will take you to all your saved snapshots, and you can select any of them to load.
* The __Compare Wizard__ button starts the compare wizard that allows you to compare two snapshots or differences in SQL server settings at different points in time.
* The __Options__ button gives you access to configuration options for adjusting SysKit SQL Manager to your needs.
* The __Live Explorer__ button allows you to view and manage your servers and databases live, without taking a snapshot.
* The __SQL Servers__ button brings you to the SQL Servers dialog from which you can detect servers from different domains or manually add servers you want to monitor. You can also include or exclude servers from a snapshot.
* The __Manage Domains__ button will take you to the Manage Domains dialog from which you can manage the domains that SysKit SQL Manager will use when loading server data.
