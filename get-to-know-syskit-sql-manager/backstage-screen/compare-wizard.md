* Entire Snapshots - compare SQL Server environment settings between two saved snapshots.
* SQL Servers - compare differences between two SQL Servers in your environment or track the changes that were made to a server over time.
* Databases - Compare and track changes made on the structure of your databases.
* Security -  Compare and track changes to SQL role permissions and user memberships.
